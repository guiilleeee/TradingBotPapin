"""Walk-forward backtest with the EQUITY universe re-screened at each historical
week boundary, instead of backtest.py's single fixed symbol list for the whole
window.

Why this is a different (stronger) question than backtest.py's plain run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In production the equity slate is not static: weekly_screening.yml re-runs
screening.py every Monday 06:00 UTC and rewrites symbols.yaml, so the 4h cycle
trades a rotating set of names, not whatever five happened to be picked once.
backtest.py's `run_backtest` answers "were the model's decisions good, given a
symbol list you chose"; this module answers "would the SYSTEM AS IT ACTUALLY
OPERATES -- weekly rescreen + 4h decisions -- have been good", which is the
question that actually matters for a real go/no-go call, since a static-list
backtest can look good or bad for reasons that have nothing to do with
whether weekly screening itself finds anything worth trading.

Reused, not reimplemented: every per-day primitive (decision_frame_for_day,
sweep_positions_for_day, run_symbol_for_day, mark_to_market_equity,
BacktestState, BacktestLogger, CostTracker, resolve_provider) comes straight
from backtest.py. The one structural change is that the day loop's symbol
list is no longer fixed -- it is resolved per day from whichever week's
screening result was most recently in effect, exactly mirroring how
main.load_config re-reads symbols.yaml fresh each cycle in production.

An open position never disappears just because its symbol rotates out of the
following week's slate: `sweep_positions_for_day` already iterates
`state.open_positions` (the ledger), never the active symbol list -- the same
way main.py's live sweep iterates every bot-managed position regardless of
what is in the current week's config.yaml/symbols.yaml. Only the decision to
open a NEW position is gated by "is this symbol in this week's slate".

Two honest, ADDITIONAL data gaps on top of backtest.py's existing two (no
historical headlines, no historical Hyperliquid positioning) -- read this
before trusting a result
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. **Survivorship-biased equity universe.** There is no free archive of
   historical S&P 500 / Nasdaq-100 constituent lists. Every historical week's
   candidate pool is drawn from TODAY's membership
   (equity_universe.build_equity_universe(), fetched once at the start of the
   run), not the membership that was actually in effect on that historical
   date. This cuts both ways and does not net out to "safe": a stock later
   removed from the index for poor performance is still in the pool and can
   still be screened OUT on its own bad numbers (fine), but a stock that
   hadn't been ADDED to the index yet is available for selection in weeks
   before it should have been eligible, and a stock that would have failed to
   qualify for membership back then is included anyway. There is no way to
   correct this without a paid point-in-time constituents dataset.
4. **No historical Hyperliquid spot volume, universe, or positioning.**
   Hyperliquid's spotMetaAndAssetCtxs only exposes today's rolling 24h volume
   and there is no free archive -- so the crypto HALF of screening.py (which
   spot markets exist, their liquidity ranking, their positioning) cannot be
   reproduced historically at all. Crypto symbols are therefore held FIXED
   for the whole run (default: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD, matching
   config.yaml) -- only the equity side is actually re-screened week to week.

Cost model is identical to backtest.py: same provider, same per-symbol
per-day model call, same CostTracker. Re-screening itself costs nothing (no
model call, pure yfinance) -- it only changes WHICH equities get evaluated
each week, not how many decisions get made per week.
