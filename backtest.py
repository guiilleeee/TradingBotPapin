"""Walk-forward backtest: does the model's reasoning actually have edge?

Everything built in earlier phases proves the system behaves safely and
consistently. This module is the first thing that asks whether its decisions
are any *good* -- the one piece standing between this project and a real
go/no-go call on live money.

Two honest, unavoidable data gaps -- read this before trusting a result
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **No historical headlines.** `data_fetcher.fetch_headlines` only returns
   *current* Yahoo RSS items; there is no free archive of "what the headlines
   were" on a past date. Every backtest day passes `recent_headlines=[]`.
   This degrades exactly the way a live headline-fetch failure already does
   (system prompt rule 5 already treats headlines as optional bias) -- no new
   code path, just less context than a live run would have.
2. **No historical Hyperliquid positioning.** The leaderboard is a live
   snapshot with no archive. `market_positioning` is `None` for every day.
Both gaps are printed in the run banner and carried in the returned report
dict (`report["limitations"]`) -- not just a code comment -- because a result
read later without this context is a result that looks better than it is.

Anti-lookahead guarantee
-------------------------
For simulated day N, `decision_frame_for_day` returns only bars *strictly
before* day N -- day N's own Close, High, Low, Volume are never in the frame
handed to `data_fetcher.compute_indicators` or used as `current_price`. Day
N's own bar is read exactly once, for its Open (the fill price) and its
High/Low (for stop/take-profit touches on a position opened on an earlier
day). See `decision_frame_for_day` and `tests/test_backtest.py`'s lookahead
tests -- one proves the real function excludes a deliberately-planted future
value, the other proves the test has teeth by showing a naive `<=` slice
would have leaked it.

Isolation
---------
A dedicated `backtest.db` (via `BacktestLogger`), never `trading_bot.db`.
Nothing here calls `execution.execute_trade`, `BotLogger()`, or any live
broker function -- every fill is computed locally from historical OHLCV.
`risk_manager.validate` and the equity-relative sizing formula from
execution.py are reused exactly as live would use them; only the venue-
specific order mechanics (whole-share-vs-notional, exchange minimums) are
out of scope here, since those affect execution plumbing, not whether the
model's calls have edge.
