"""secrets_redaction.py: the single source of truth notifications.py,
execution.py, and equity_universe.py all import `sanitize` from.

notifications.py's own tests (test_notifications.py) already cover the
literal-value scrub and the bot-token/hex backstops end to end through
notifications._sanitize (a re-export of this module's `sanitize`) -- this
file focuses on what's new here: the FMP query-string pattern, and confirming
the module's public names are what execution.py/equity_universe.py actually
import.
